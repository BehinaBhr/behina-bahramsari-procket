### Problem
<!-- Why is your app needed? Background information around any pain points or other reasons. -->
Procrastination is a common challenge for many people, leading to missed deadlines, unmet goals, and increased stress. Existing planning apps often lack insights into why tasks are delayed or abandoned, making it difficult for users to improve their productivity.

Procrastination affects up to 20% of the adult population in the United States, leading to decreased productivity, missed deadlines, and increased stress levels (American Psychological Association, APA). Research conducted by Steel and Klingsieck in 2016 has shown that procrastination is associated with poorer performance and well-being outcomes, with individuals experiencing higher levels of stress and anxiety due to the uncertainty and pressure of impending deadlines. Moreover, Pychyl and Flett's study in 2012 suggests that procrastination is often linked to a fear of failure and perfectionism, leading individuals to delay tasks out of concern for not meeting their own high standards or fear of the consequences of potential failure.


Interventions targeting procrastination have been shown to be effective in improving productivity and well-being. Sirois and Pychyl's study in 2013 demonstrated that strategies such as goal setting, time management techniques, and self-monitoring can lead to a reduction in procrastination behavior and improved academic performance. Additionally, incorporating elements of gamification into productivity apps has been found to enhance user engagement and motivation. By turning task completion into a rewarding and visually appealing experience, users are more likely to stay committed to their goals and persist in their efforts to overcome procrastination.

Procket integrates these effective strategies into its design by providing users with customizable goal-setting tools, time management features, and visual progress tracking. By gamifying the task completion process with the metaphor of assembling a rocket, users are incentivized to stay on track and take consistent action towards their goals. Additionally, Procket offers insights into procrastination patterns through advanced analytics, empowering users to identify and address underlying causes of procrastination. By understanding their habits and triggers, users can develop effective strategies to overcome procrastination and maintain momentum towards their goals. Overall, Procket's comprehensive approach to addressing procrastination combines evidence-based strategies with engaging design elements to provide users with an effective solution for improving productivity and achieving their goals."
